        <h2>How Service Animals Help</h2>
        <p>Animals have been shown to have a number of benefits for mental health. For example, they can help to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. They can also help to improve mood, social interaction, and overall well-being.</p>
        <div class="with-img">
            <img src="img/doggo.png" alt="Kid &amp; dog" width="400" height="400">
            <div class="right">
                <p>One of the ways that animals can help mental health is by providing companionship. Companionship is important for mental health because it provides a sense of belonging and support. Animals can provide companionship in a number of ways. They can be a source of comfort and support, especially during difficult times. They can also provide a sense of purpose and responsibility.</p>
                <p>Another way that animals can help mental health is by providing physical activity. Physical activity is important for mental health because it releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Animals can encourage physical activity in a number of ways. They can provide a reason to get outside and exercise. They can also provide motivation to keep moving.</p>
                <p>“Pets can provide companionship, unconditional love, and a sense of purpose, all of which can help improve mental health,” said Dr. Jodi Bennett, a psychiatrist and spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/News-room/News-Releases/Positive-Mental-Health-Impact-of-Pets" target="_blank">American Psychiatric Association</a>.</p>
                <p>Finally, animals can help mental health by providing unconditional love. Unconditional love is important for mental health because it provides a sense of security and acceptance. Animals can provide unconditional love in a number of ways. They are always happy to see their owners, no matter what. They are also non-judgmental and accepting.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Here are some quotes from the <a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2018/02/power-pets#:~:text=Interacting%20with%20animals%20has%20been,support%2C%20and%20boost%20your%20mood." target="_blank">National Institues of Health</a> (part of the US Department of Health and Human Services) that support these claims:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Interacting with animals has been shown to decrease levels of cortisol (a stress-related hormone) and lower blood pressure. Other studies have found that animals can reduce loneliness, increase feelings of social support, and boost your mood."</li>
            <li>"Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is a type of therapy that uses animals to help people with a variety of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). AAT has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of these conditions and improving overall well-being."</li>
            <li>"Service animals are trained to provide assistance to people with disabilities. They can help people with tasks such as walking, getting dressed, and opening doors. Service animals can also provide emotional support, which can be helpful for people with mental health conditions."</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Dr. Therabot is a good alternative method to animals for helping mental health because it provides the same benefits, but with some added advantages. Dr. Therabot is always available to talk, and it will never judge you. It can also provide personalized advice and support, based on your individual needs.</p>
        <p>If you are struggling with mental health, consider talking to your doctor about getting a pet or using Dr. Therabot. Both can be helpful in reducing symptoms and improving overall well-being.</p>
