        <p>Here are some additional tips for interacting with Dr. Therabot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dr. Therabot isn't a real "doctor," nor a real therapist. However, it's been tailored to emulate theraputic advice. <em>Try to see a <strong>human therapist</strong> as soon as possible if you need help!</strong></li>
            <li>Be clear and concise in your messages. Dr. Therabot currently uses OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, which is an LLM (Large Language Model). At this point in time, all LLMs are still under development. They may not always understand your messages if they are not clear and concise, <strong>and may provide inaccurate information.</strong></li>
            <li>Use natural language. Dr. Therabot's LLM is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can understand natural language, so you can talk to it like you would talk to a friend.</li>
            <li>Be patient. Dr. Therabot is still under development, so it may not always be able to answer your questions or complete your requests immediately. This is especially true during times of high-traffic that OpenAI may be experiencing. Check OpenAI's <a href="https://status.openai.com">Status</a> page for up-to-date info about their servers.</li>
