# Dr. Therabot


## Setup:
1. Install composer (and autoloader.php)
2. Run:
 - composer require openai-php/client
 - composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle 
 
## TODO (suggestions from Bard):
- You could add a section about the benefits of therapy for people with PTSD. This would be helpful for people who are considering using Dr. Therabot but aren't sure if it's right for them.
- You could also add a section about the research that has been done on the effectiveness of animal-assisted therapy. This would help to legitimize Dr. Therabot and make it more appealing to potential users.
- Finally, you could add a blog section where you could share stories about how Dr. Therabot has helped people. This would be a great way to show the positive impact that Dr. Therabot can have on people's lives.
